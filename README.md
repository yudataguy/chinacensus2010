# China Census 2010 Data 

Lanaguage: **Chinese**

This is the entire China 2010 Census published data in excel format, which I scraped from National Bureau of Statistics of China. I was not expecting this depth of data. Due to the quantity of the files, I can not translate each one of them in a timely fashion. Even Machine translation lacks accuracy. Therefore crowdsource is the best appraoch to have all the files translated into English. If you are interested in census data or Chinese language, please participate. If you can make a script to automate the translation process, please participate as well. 

Here's all the standard translation for some parts of the documents, since most of them share the same characters.
